1. getElementById selects a single element by its unique ID in the DOM. We use it when there’s only one element we want to target in the HTML document, like a Login button, Sign Up button, or Submit button. getElementsByClassName selects all elements that share a specific class. It returns an HTMLCollection, which looks a bit like an array but isn’t exactly one. The collection is live, meaning it automatically updates if the DOM changes after you’ve selected the elements. querySelector selects the first element that matches a CSS selector. It can handle any valid selector—ID, class, tag name, or even a more complex nested selector. If nothing matches, it just returns null. querySelectorAll selects all elements that match a CSS selector. Unlike querySelector, it grabs every match, not just the first one. It returns a NodeList, which behaves like an array but is static, so it doesn’t change if the DOM is updated later.
2. To create and insert new elements in the DOM, we use document.createElement() method to create an element and then insert the new element into a parent node by using parentNodeVariable.appendChild() or parentNodeVariable.append(). This process dynamically adds new elements to our webpage. This way we can show a particular part of code in our page after triggering any event.
3. Event Bubbling happens when an event, like a click, occurs on a child element and then naturally moves up to its parent, then the parent’s parent, and so on, all the way to the top of the page. The event starts where the interaction happens and travels upward through the DOM. This makes it easier to manage events and allows techniques like event delegation, where a parent handles events from multiple children.
4. Event Delegation in JavaScript means adding one event listener to a parent instead of many on its children. When a child triggers an event, it bubbles up, letting the parent handle it. This approach saves code, boosts performance, and works well for elements added dynamically.
5. preventDefault() is used when you want to stop the browser from doing its usual action, like following a link or submitting a form. stopPropagation() is used when you want to stop an event from bubbling up to parent elements, so only the element you interacted with handles it.
